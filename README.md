| Sensitivity analysis | Jelena Srebric | Summary of local and global methods | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wNxZcvRdPI |
| Using the SALib library for conducting sensitivity analyses of models | Will Usher | Presentation at PyData 2015 about a library that performs sensitivity analysis on Python with step-by-step examples | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkR_lz5OptU |
| Sensitivity Analysis in Bayesian networks | Adnan Darwiche | Chapter 16 of a UCLA course -- Learning and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks. Discusses the relationship between network parameters and queries. Explores how one can bound changes to queries in terms of changes to parameters; how one can change parameters to ensure some constraints on the results of queries; and how one can measure change to parameters so as to provide guarantees on the network robustness. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3sefsvWfDQ |
