A list of videos, books and paper about Sensitivity analysis


## Books

There are several books about the topic.

* Borgonovo, Emanuele. Sensitivity Analysis: An Introduction for the Management Scientist. 2017. Springer International Publishing. ISBN 978-3-319-52259-3. https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319522579
  - This book is an introduction to the methodology of sensitivity analysis of model output. Primarily intended for people that are familiar with mathematical models but less familiar with the techniques for performing sensitivity analysis.

| Sensitivity Analysis in Bayesian networks | Adnan Darwiche | Chapter 16 of a UCLA course -- Learning and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks. Discusses the relationship between network parameters and queries. Explores how one can bound changes to queries in terms of changes to parameters; how one can change parameters to ensure some constraints on the results of queries; and how one can measure change to parameters so as to provide guarantees on the network robustness. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3sefsvWfDQ |
